## 🧭 3. Understanding the Unity User Interface (UI)

When you open Unity, the layout might seem overwhelming at first — but don't worry, it's easy once you know what each panel does. Here's a quick breakdown:

### 🔳 Scene View
- This is your "workspace" — where you design and build your game.
- You can drag, move, rotate, and scale GameObjects here.
- Think of it like your level editor.

### 🎮 Game View
- This shows what the player will see when they play the game.
- Hit the ▶️ (Play) button at the top to preview the game in this window.

### 🧱 Hierarchy
- Lists **all GameObjects** in your current Scene.
- This is where you’ll find things like the Camera, Lights, and your Player object.
- You can drag things in and out to organize objects (like putting enemies inside a folder called "Enemies").

### ⚙️ Inspector
- When you select any GameObject, its properties show up here.
- You can change the position, size, color, add scripts, colliders, and more from this panel.

### 📁 Project
- This is your file manager inside Unity.
- Everything you import or create (scripts, images, audio, etc.) lives here in folders.

### 💬 Console
- Displays messages like errors, warnings, and print/debug logs from your scripts.
- Super useful for finding issues in your game.
